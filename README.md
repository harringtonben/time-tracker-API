## Time Tracker App Front End

This is the back end portion of the time tracker app that I built as a final capstone as Nashville Software School for the support team managers at Emma to be able to track shift data for the team members and get better metrics and reporting on that data.

#### Built With: 

- ASP.NET Core
- Dapper
- Azure hosted SQL database
- Entity Framework


#### How to run (ASP.NET Core SDK must be installed on your machine):

```git clone (git@github.com:harringtonben/time-tracker-API.git)
cd (time-tracker-API)
dotnet run
```

#####  This will be available to hit via postment at the port specified in your IDE, or by utilizing the [front end portion](https://github.com/harringtonben/time-tracker-frontend) of this app.
